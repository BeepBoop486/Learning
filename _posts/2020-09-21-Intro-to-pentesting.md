This course is meant to be a very gentle yet thorough guide to the world of hacking and penetration testing. It’s specifically aimed at helping you master the basic steps needed to complete a hack or penetration test without overwhelming you. By the time you end this course, you’ll have a solid understanding of the penetration testing process and you’ll be comfortable with the basic tools needed to complete the job.

Specifically, this course is aimed at people who are new to the world of hacking and penetration testing, for those with little or no previous experience, for those who are frustrated by the inability to see the big picture (how the various tools and phases fit together), or those looking to expand their knowledge of offensive security.

In short, this course is made for anyone interested in computer security, hacking or penetration testing but has no prior experience and not sure where to begin.

**This course is based on "The basics of penetration testing", a book from Pat
Engebretson. There are some things updated.**

This course is also moved from my old website
[H4CK1NGB00TC4MP](https://h4ck1ngb00tc4mp.gq) so if it's mentioned later, you
know what it does reffer to.
