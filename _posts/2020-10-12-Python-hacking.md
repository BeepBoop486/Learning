Learn python completely from scratch and how to use it to perform penetration
tests, forensics analysis, device, web and network exploitation and much more.
Note that, even though in this course python from a very basic level is
explained, it is recommended to take a python course if you would like to learn
this language in deep.

**This course is based in the book "_Violent Python: A cookbok for Hackers,
Forensic Analysts, Penetration Testers and Security Engineers_" by TJ. O'
Connor.**
