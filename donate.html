<p>Hello everybody! If you are here, thank you so much!.</p>
<p>Learning is an indie project, currently it is being maintained for only one
person (as of date 2020-09-24). I've programmed Learning, I've created the blog,
I've written a few entries, I've added many courses, and all of that will always
be free.</p>
<p>At the very beginning (about May 2020) I started out with the very first
prototype of an LMS system by using WordPress, it was sooo good, there could be
users, there was a forum, the instructors could get earnings by publishing
courses, there were quizzes and a lot of other features, but as WordPress is
made in PHP it requires an "special" hosting, one that supports PHP as it is not
a static language as it is HTML, I tried hosting that site in a lot of different
free hostings (as I couldn't afford a paid one), but it always got suspended, in
some places because of its high CPU usage, in some others because its content
was illegal (as it was an only-hacking online school).</p>
<p>Then, I started out to experiment with Jekyll, and the [second
site](https://h4ck1ngb00tc4mp.gq) was created. I didn't know that much about
using jekyll for creating my own theme, so I was using one that I found
navigating in GitHub, but it was so simply, so it discouraged me so much.</p>
<p>Two days ago (2020-09-22) I started working in this Learning version, it is
so much complete, it is way more beautiful, the content is more organised and
there are way much more pages, someday I would like to work like it was in the
first version of Learning (previously called h4ck1ngb00tc4mp and then renamed to
CashSchool), but to do that I would need to be paying a VPS service, I would
like to work in some other projects or to write better courses (Unity or Unreal
Engine courses) but I can't do that because of my computer, to make all of these
things better, to evolve Learning to a way much more better website I need
money.</p>
<p>I don't want Learning to be a paid website, because there are a lot of them,
and almost all of the guides or tutorials you find free on the Internet are so
poor (there are exceptions, obviously) I want to change all of that, I want to
make this a complete learning portal, unlike freeCodeCamp not only about
programming, it would be amazing if there are Chess courses, personal growth,
social techniques and all of that stuff.</p>

<i>Before you leave this page, CashSchool wasn't called "CashSchool" because you
were supposed to win a lot of cash by enroling in our courses or even creating
them, it was called "CashSchool" after Johnny Cash.</i>
