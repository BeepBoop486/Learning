Hello everybody, it's me Sarah!

I am so so sorry, it's been a long time since I dont' update this website, I
kinda lost the interest for a while and started to do other things, it could be
like... One in a year vacations? It helped me a lot, it made me to fall in
account about what I wanted to do, my philosophy changed, I switched like three
different linux distros, learned a lot more about hacking and welp... That's
almost all.

I want to make Learning different, at least a bit, I won't made any other course
based in a book and try to take from little to no references, quotes or
examples. I also changed the list of courses I want to upload here, this is how
my To-Do list currently looks like:

<br>

* C Programming for beginners
* The basics of network hacking
* Advanced network hacking
* Social Engineering
* Privacy and anonymity

What do you think about it? I am not a creative person so... It probably could
be better, I hope you comment things you would like to learn and... Welp, thanks
for waiting and sorry for leaving this amazing project. Thanks :3
