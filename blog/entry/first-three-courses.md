Hello, everybody! It's me, Sarah.

Thank you so much for using Learning. I feel like this platform is finally
growing, there was two pull requests in its official GitHub repository, I posted
this website in three different subreddits and each of them has more than 100
upvotes (all together are more than 1k), there are a lot of visits to the code
and a lot of cloners and visitors. Thank you!

So far Learning has only two courses:

- The basics of penetration testing
- Create your own malware using C

Today I'm starting another one called: "C For Beginners", which is basically
about... C.. For beginners.

There are a lot of other courses in my To-Do list, which are:

- Creating botnets in Python
- Social engineering (about computers, for example, sending payloads, etcetera)
- Social engineering (about people, for example, manipulation)
- Creating Rootkits
- Website hacking
- Cracking passwords with JohnTheRipper
- Metasploit
- NMap
- Anonymity

And many other programming languages. Those are a lot of courses, a lot of
lessons and a lot of words, pages, lines of code and many other stuff. I
probably won't publish them all until the finish of this year, probably in 365
days there is a bit more than the half of them. But anyways, I'll create them
all.

If you want to contribute to Learning and create your own course, modify a
lesson or even simply writing a blog entry, you can clone [its source
code](https://github.com/HermadesCGCO/Learning) and follow the [Contribution
Guide guidelines](/contribute).

Note that Learning is not just about hacking or programming, it's a
learn-everything website, are you good at chess? Write a chess course, Are you
good at Video editing? Write a video editing course, Are you a good actor?
Write an acting course, there are no limits (as long as it is quality content).
You can also contribute by [performing donations](/donate) and spreading the
word. In any case, I will be so pleased!.
