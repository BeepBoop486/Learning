Hello everybody, I'm Sarah!

As you may noted, Learning has passed through a very BIG change. I have
redesigned its design, basically I has to change the theme, but I loved the
results.

I have a lot of new and amazing stuff planned to do with Learning, and this is
the first step to perform all of those things. The old template has a plethora
of errors, it wasn't as responsible as it shall be and it looked kind of
outdated. I hope you like this new design (it took me 9 hours to do btw)!. I will post a few pictures of the
old learning compared with the new one.
