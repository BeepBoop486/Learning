    Hi! I'm Sarah. I'm a grey-hat hacktivist, I am a free software enthusiast
    I am not a professional but I like teaching other what I know, as the knowledge
    is worth nothing if it belongs to only one person.<br><br>
    I am 15 years old, and the creator of Learning. I hope you enjoy it and learn so much <3
