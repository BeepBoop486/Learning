In the following lessons, we will tackle the idea of variables, data types,
strings, complex data structures, networking, selection, iteration, file
handling, exception handling and interoperability with the operating system. To
illustrate this, we will build a simple vulnerability scanner that connects to a
TCP socket, reads the banner from a service and compares that banner against
known vulnerable service versions. As an experienced programmer, you may find
some of the initial colde examples very ugly in design. In fact, hopefully you
do. As we continue to develop our script in this section, the script will grow
  into an elegant design you can appreciate. Let's begin by starting with the
bedrock of any programming language. Variables.
