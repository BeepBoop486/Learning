One of the biggest doubts when starting in hacking is: "How did they do this?",
"How does this tool work?", in this course you'll probably find an answer for
similar questions, why? I'll teach you how to code your own malware, how you can
trick your victim to download it and open it, and how you can gain control over
their machine by adding a persistence and keylogger functionalities.

## "Persistence"?

When exploiting vulnerabilities with tools like "Metasploit" you'll usually gain
total access to your target's machine, almost all of them are not persistent,
which means, they will be erased once your victim shutdows or reboots the
machine. By adding a persistence it'll let the malware to start once the
operating system is started.

You will also learn how to connect two machines over the internet, send and
receive signals, manipulate the other computer, manage files, steal passwords
and many more.
