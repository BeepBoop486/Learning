As the name suggests the "**Control Instructions**" enable us to specify the
order in which the various instructions in a program are going to be executed by
the computer. In other words, the control instructions determine the "**flow of
control**" in a program. There are four types of control instructions in C. They
are:

* Sequence Control Instruction
* Selection or Decision Control Instruction
* Repetition or Loop Control Instruction
* Case Control Instruction

The "_Sequence Control Instruction_" ensures that the instructions are executed
in the same order in which they appear in the program. "_Decision and Case
Control_" instructions allows the computer to take a decision to which
instruction is going to be executed next. The "_Loop Control_" instruction helps
the computer to execute a group of statements repeatedly. In the following
lessons we are going to learn these instructions in detail.
