The programs that we have developer so far, used either a sequential or a
decision control instruction. In the first one, the calculations were carried
out in a fixed order, while in the second, an appropriate set of instructions
were executed depending upon the outcome of the condition being tested (or a
logical decision being taken).

These programs were of limited nature, because when executed, they always
performed the same series of actions, in the same way, exactly one. Almost
always, if something is worth doing, it's worth doing more than once. You can
probably think of several examples of this from real life, such as eating a good
dinner or going for a movie. Programming is the same; we frequently need to
perform an action over and over, often with variations in the details each time.
The mechanism, which meets this need, is the '_loop_' and loops are the subject
of this section.

# Loops

The versatility of the computer lies on its ability to perform a set of
instructions repeatedly. This involves repeating some portion of the program,
either a specific number of times or until a particular condition is being
satisfied. This repetitive operation is done through a loop control instruction.

There are three methods by way of which we can repeat a part of a program. They
are:

1. Using a **for** statement.
2. Using a **while** statement.
3. Using a **do-while** statement.

Each of these methods will be discussed in this section
