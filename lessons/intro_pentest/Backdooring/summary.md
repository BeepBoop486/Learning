This chapter focused on the use and implementation of backdoors and rootkits.
Remember, itâ€™s vital that you have the proper authorization before utilizing a
rootkit or backdoor in a penetration test. This chapter began by introducing the
powerful and flexible tool Netcat. Several uses of Netcat, including
implementing Netcat as a backdoor, are covered. Cryptcat, a modern version of
Netcat with the added ability to encrypt traffic between two machines, was also
discussed. The chapter concluded with a brief overview of rootkits including
their basic structure and use.
