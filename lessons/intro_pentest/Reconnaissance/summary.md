Information gathering is the first step in any penetration test or hack.
Although this phase is less technical than most, its importance shouldn’t be
overlooked. The more information you’re able to collect, the better your chances
of success of later phases of the penetration test. At first, the amount of
information that can be gathered on your target can seem a bit overwhelming, but
with a good documentation process, the proper use of tools and further practise
you’ll soon master the art of reconnaissance.
