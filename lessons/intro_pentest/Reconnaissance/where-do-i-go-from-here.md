Once you’ve practised and mastered the basics of reconnaissance, you’ll be armed
with enough information and skill to tackle advanced topics in information
gathering. The following is a list of tools and techniques that will take you
information-gathering ability to the next level:

* Search engines directives for sites other than Google:
  * Now that your knowledge about Google directives is strong, you need to
    master this technique using other search engines. Most modern search engines
    includes directives or other ways to complete advanced searches. Remember
    you should never rely on a single search engine to do all of your
    reconnaissance. Searching for the same keywords in different search engines
    often return drastically different and surprisingly useful results.
* Exploit DB Google Hacking Database (GHDB)
  * This is a single repository for some of the most effective and feared Google
    Hacks in existence today! It has already been mentioned and should go
    without saying but **DON'T RUN THESE QUERIES AGAINST UNAUTHORISED TARGETS**
    You can find the GHDB at [https://exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database](https://exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)
* Paterva's Maltego CE
  * Maltego is a very powerful tool that aggregates information from public
    databases and provides shockingly accurate details about your target
    organization. These details can be technical in nature, such as the location
    or IP address of your firewall, etcetera.
