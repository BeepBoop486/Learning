Once you’ve mastered the basics of Nmap and Nessus, you should dig into the
advanced options for both tools. This chapter only scratched the surface of both
of these fine tools. Insecure.org is a great resource for learning more about
Nmap. You should dedicate time to exploring and learning all the various
switches and options. Likewise, Nessus has a plethora of additional features.
Take time to review the various scans and policy options.

After you’re comfortable with the advanced features of these tools, you should
look at other scanners as well. There are dozens of good port scanners
available. Pick a few; install them and learn their features. There are several
commercial products that you should become familiar with; these products ain’t
exclusively vulnerability scanners (they’re much more), but Core Compact and
Saint both provide excellent vulnerability assessment components, although both
of these will cost you actual cash.
