This chapter focused on step 2 that consists mainly of scanning. The chapter
started with a brief overview of pings and ping sweeps before moving into the
specifics of scanning. The topic of scanning is further broken down into two
distinct types including port scanning and vulnerability scanning. The port
scanner Nmap was introduced and several different types of scans were discussed.
Actual examples and outputs of the various scans were demonstrated as well as
the interpretation of the Nmap output. The concept of vulnerability scanning was
introduced through the use of Nessus. Practical examples were presented and
discussed throughout the chapter.
