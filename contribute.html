<h1>Contribute to Learning</h1>

<p>Hi! The following is a guide to contribute content and fixes to
Learning. Thank you in advance.</p>

<h2>Creating a new Course</h2>

Creating a new course in Learning is so simple. There are a few things you have
to take into account before doing it:

<ol>
  <li>Registering yourself as a tutor</li>
  <li>Register your course category</li>
  <li>Registering a new course</li>
  <li>Creating a page for your course</li>
  <li>Creating lessons</li>
</ol>

<h3>Registering yourself as a tutor</h3>

<p>In order to register yourself as a tutor, you have to go to the file
"`_data/tutors.yml`" and open it with your favourite text editor.</p>
<p>At the very end of the file, copy and paste the following and modify the
values as they are explained later:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight">
<code>tutorId:
  name: Tutor name
  twitter: Your twitter  @
  pp: your profile picture relative url
  about: >-
    A brief description about you
  roles:
    - Tell the world
    - What are the things you are best at</code>
    </pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The values you'd have to modify are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tutorId: An id which will be used throughout the website. When creating a
  new course you won't pass your tutor username, but your tutor id. Note that
  this <b>MUST</b> be unique. So, before creating yours, please search first in
  the entire document if that ID hasn't been already registered.</li>
  <li>name: The name which will be publicly available. This will be the one
    that will appear in the courses' about the tutor section, the blog entries,
  etcetera.</li>
  <li>twitter: Your twitter's @ (without the "@" symbol)</li>
  <li>pp: Your profile picture's relative url. First upload the image to
    "/images/tutorIcons/" and use that URL</li>
  <li>about: A description about you, note that using the ">-" will make that
    field multiline until a new variable "name:" is found</li>
  <li>roles: Your roles, the things you are good at, for example, programming,
    hacking, video editing, etcetera. Please use only two and single-worded
    roles.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Register your course category</h3>

<p>Go to the file "_data/courses/categories.yml" and see if the category of the
course you will create already exists, for example: "Video Editing". If not, add
the following lines at the end of the file:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight">
<code> category:
  name: Video Editing
  slug: video-editing
  description: Learn to edit videos</code>
    </pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>You'll need to modify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>category: The same as slug</li>
  <li>name: The name of the category.</li>
  <li>slug: The name of the category without spaces, for example,
    "game-development"</li>
  <li>description: A brief description about the category</li>
</ul>

<p>If you had to register the category, go to "category/" and create a new file
called "slug.md", replacing "`slug`" with the slug you put in the yml file. To
the "md" file add the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight">
<code>---
title: Video editing
category: video-editing
layout: category
---</code>
    </pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>You'd need to modify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>title: The name of the category you registered in the ".yml" file</li>
  <li>category: The slug you registered in the ".yml" file</li>
</ul>

<h3>Registering a new course</h3>

<p>Once you already have a tutor ID, it's time to register your course. The
following are the steps to follow in order to create a course:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a new file at "data/courses" whose name will be the course id,
    note that this <b>MUST</b> be unique and it'll be used throughout this
    website.</li>
  <li>Copy and paste the following template:</li>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight">
<code>title: Course title
description: Tell the world what are they going to learn in this course (short
description only)
thumb: relative url to the thumbnail
url: /Permalink-URL/
tags:
  - Beginners
  - Course
  - Video Editing
  - Kdenlive
youlearn:
  - The very basics of video editing
  - Manipulate transitions as a master
requirements:
  - A linux distribution
contents:
  - name: Getting started
    desc: Getting started with the Kdenlive interface
    contents:
      - name: Introduction
        url: /lessons/course_id/Introduction/lesson-name
duration: 20hrs
tutor: sarah
language: english
category: video-editing
completed: 0</code>
      </pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</ul>

<p>You have to modify the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>title: The public name of the course, for example: "The basics of
    Kdenlive"</li>
  <li>description: A short description about the course, the one that appears in
  the "Explore" section</li>
  <li>thumb: Relative url for the course thumbnail</li>
  <li>url: The url of the course main page (overview)</li>
  <li>tags: A list containing the tags of the course</li>
  <li>youlearn: The list of things that will appear in the "What you will learn"
  section of a course overview page</li>
  <li>requirements: The list of things that will appear in the "Requirements"
    section of a course overview page</li>
  <li>contents: A list of lists. The first list (the one following after
    "contents:") will be a section. The "contents:" list will be the lessons of
  that section. Consider the following example</li>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight">
<code>contents:
  - name: Getting started
    desc: Getting started with the Kdenlive concept
    contents:
      - name: GUI
        url: /lessons/course_id/Introduction/lesson-name
      - name: Concepts
        url: /lessons/course_id/Introduction/lesson-name
  - name: Transitions
    desc: Create your first transition
    contents:
      - name: Creating transitions
        url: /lessons/course_id/Introduction/lesson-name
      - name: Modifying a transition value
        url: /lessons/course_id/Introduction/lesson-name</code>
      </pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <li>duration: The duration of the course (add "hrs" at the end)</li>
  <li>language: The language of the course, for example, english or spanish</li>
  <li>category: Category slug</li>
  <li>completed: If you course is completed, replace the "0" for a "1"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Creating a page for your course</h3>

<p>Once you've registered your course, it won't be visible as it is not properly
created, you have registered all of the data of your course, but... That data is
not used anywhere. Create a markdown file (extension ".md") in the "_posts/"
directory, the file name should follow this schema:
"YEAR-MONTH-DAY-Post-Name.md" don't overthink the "Post-Name" as it won't be
really important. The name should look like this:
"2020-09-24-Introduction-kdenlive.md".</p>
<p>The following code <b>MUST</b> be at the beginning of the file:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight">
<code>---
course: course_id
layout: course
---</code>
    </pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>You must modify the following values:</p>
<ul>
  <li>course: The course id you registered previously at "_data/courses/"</li>
</ul>

<p>After these three lines, you can add content to your course normally. When
talking about "content" I mean a larger description about your course.</p>
<p>Once all of those steps are completed, you can now go on to creating lessons.</p>

<h3>Creating lessons</h3>

<p>When you have registered your course and added it to the page. Now it's time
to add content to it. There is a directory at the Learning root folder called
"lessons" there you have to create a new directory, which it's name will be the
course ID those lessons belong to. Then, for each section in the course, you'll
have to create a new folder with its name (or a shorter one if that name contains
spaces or many words together), this is not really important, but it helps
to keep Learning organised. Now, create a new file with the lesson name (or a
shorter name if it contains many spaces or several words), for example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight">
<code>/lessons/intro_kdenlive/Introduction/intro-to-kdenlive.md</code>
    </pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Every lesson <b>MUST</b> have at its beginning the following lines:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight">
<code>---
title: Introduction to Kdenlive
course: intro_kdenlive
section: "Introduction"
layout: lesson
---</code>
    </pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The values you'll have to modify are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>title: The name of the lesson (it <b>MUST</b> be the same you registered
    at "_data/courses/course_id.yml")</li>
  <li>course: The course_id you created before</li>
  <li>section: The section that lesson you are creating belongs to</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating a quiz</h2>

<p>TODO: This</p>

<h2>Creating your tutor profile</h2>

<p>To create your tutor profile "/tutor/tutorId", go to the "tutor/" directory,
create a new markdown file (".md" extension) which name <b>MUST</b> be your
tutor ID and add the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight">
<code>---
title: Tutor name
tutor: tutorId
layout: tutor
---</code>
    </pre>
  </div>
</div>
